	<p>One of the most important tasks in the research process is to review the relevant literature. 
	It is a compilation of previous study findings on connected issues that are directly and indirectly
	related.  This review informs researchers on what is already known and what needs to be tested
	in relation to the research issue. It assists the researcher in avoiding duplication of effort and
	offers helpful suggestions for additional research on the subject. A literature review is an
	examination of scholarly sources on a particular subject. It gives us a broad picture of current
	knowledge, helping us to spot pertinent ideas, methodologies, and research gaps. In general,
	the goal of a review is to critically examine a portion of a published body of information by
	summarising, classifying, and comparing previous research investigations of literature and
	theoretical pieces.</p>
